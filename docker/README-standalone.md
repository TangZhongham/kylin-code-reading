## Standalone/Self-contained Kylin deployment for learning

In order to allow users to easily try Kylin, and to facilitate developers to verify and debug after modifying the source code. We provide the all-in-one Kylin docker image. In this image, each service that Kylin relies on is properly installed and deployed, including:

- Jdk 1.8
- Hadoop 2.7.0
- Hive 1.2.1
- Hbase 1.1.2 (With Zookeeper)
- Spark 2.3.1
- Kafka 1.1.1
- MySQL 5.1.73

## Quickly try Kylin with pre-built images

We have pushed the Kylin images to the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apachekylin/apache-kylin-standalone). You do not need to build the image locally, just pull the image from remote (you can browse docker hub to check the available versions):

```
docker pull apachekylin/apache-kylin-standalone:3.1.0
```

After the pull is successful, execute "sh run_container.sh" or the following command to start the container:

```
docker run -d \
-m 8G \
-p 7070:7070 \
-p 8088:8088 \
-p 50070:50070 \
-p 8032:8032 \
-p 8042:8042 \
-p 16010:16010 \
--name apache-kylin-standalone \
apachekylin/apache-kylin-standalone:3.1.0
```

The following services are automatically started when the container starts: 

- NameNode, DataNode
- ResourceManager, NodeManager
- HBase
- Kafka
- Kylin

and run automatically `$KYLIN_HOME/bin/sample.sh `, create a kylin_streaming_topic topic in Kafka and continue to send data to this topic. This is to let the users start the container and then experience the batch and streaming way to build the cube and query.

After the container is started, we can enter the container through the `docker exec` command. Of course, since we have mapped the specified port in the container to the local port, we can open the pages of each service directly in the native browser, such as: 

- Kylin Web UI: [http://127.0.0.1:7070/kylin/login](http://127.0.0.1:7070/kylin/login)
- HDFS NameNode Web UI: [http://127.0.0.1:50070](http://127.0.0.1:50070/)
- YARN ResourceManager Web UI: [http://127.0.0.1:8088](http://127.0.0.1:8088/)
- HBase Web UI: [http://127.0.0.1:16010](http://127.0.0.1:16010/)

In the container, the relevant environment variables are as follows: 

```
JAVA_HOME=/home/admin/jdk1.8.0_141
HADOOP_HOME=/home/admin/hadoop-2.7.0
KAFKA_HOME=/home/admin/kafka_2.11-1.1.1
SPARK_HOME=/home/admin/spark-2.3.1-bin-hadoop2.6
HBASE_HOME=/home/admin/hbase-1.1.2
HIVE_HOME=/home/admin/apache-hive-1.2.1-bin
```

After about 1 to 2 minutes, all the services should be started. At the Kylin login page (http://127.0.0.1:7070/kylin), enter ADMIN:KYLIN to login, select the "learn_kylin" project. In the "Model" tab, you should be able to see two sample cubes: "kylin_sales_cube" and "kylin_streaming_cube". If they don't appear, go to the "System" tab, and then click "Reload metadata", they should be loaded.

In the "Model" tab, you can click "Build" to build the two sample cubes. After the cubes be built, try some queries in the "Insight" tab.

If you want to login into the Docker container, run "docker exec -it apache-kylin-standalone bash" to login it with bash:

```
> docker exec -it apache-kylin-standalone bash
[root@c15d10ff6bf1 admin]# ls
apache-hive-1.2.1-bin                  apache-maven-3.6.1  first_run     hbase-1.1.2   kafka_2.11-1.1.1
apache-kylin-3.0.0-alpha2-bin-hbase1x  entrypoint.sh       hadoop-2.7.0  jdk1.8.0_141  spark-2.3.1-bin-hadoop2.6
```

Or you can run "docker ps" to get the container id:

```
> docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                              COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                                                                                                NAMES

```

Then run "docker exec -it <container id> bash" to login it with bash:

```
> docker exec -it c15d10ff6bf1 bash
[root@c15d10ff6bf1 admin]# ls
apache-hive-1.2.1-bin                  apache-maven-3.6.1  first_run     hbase-1.1.2   kafka_2.11-1.1.1

```

## Build Docker image in local

You can build the docker image by yourself with the provided Dockerfile. Here we separate the scripts into several files:

- Dockerfile_hadoop: build a Hadoop image with Hadoop/Hive/HBase/Spark/Kafka and other components installed;
- Dockerfile: based on the Hadoop image, download Kylin from apache website and then start all services.
- Dockerfile_dev: similar with "Dockerfile", instead of downloading the released version, it copies local built Kylin package to the image.

Others:
- conf/: the Hadoop/HBase/Hive/Maven configuration files for this docker; Will copy them into the image on 'docker build';
- entrypoint.sh: the entrypoint script, which will start all the services;

The build is very simple:

```
./build_image.sh
```
The script will build the Hadoop image first, and then build Kylin image based on it. Depends on the network bandwidth, the first time may take a while.

## Customize the Docker image

You can customize these scripts and Dockerfile to make your image.

For example, if you made some code change in Kylin, you can make a new binary package in local with:

```
./build/scripts/package.sh
```

The new package is generated in "dist/" folder; Copy it to the "docker" folder:

```
cp ./dist/apache-kylin-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz ./docker
```

Use the "Dockerfile_dev" file to build:

```
docker build -f Dockerfile_dev -t apache-kylin-standalone:test .

```

## Build Docker image for your Hadoop environment

You can run Kylin in Docker with your Hadoop cluster. In this case, you need to build a customized image:

- Use the same version Hadoop components as your cluster;
- Use your cluster's configuration files (copy to conf/);
- Modify the "entrypoint.sh", only start Kylin, no need to start other Hadoop services;


## Container resource recommendation

In order to allow Kylin to build the cube smoothly, the memory resource we configured for Yarn NodeManager is 6G, plus the memory occupied by each service, please ensure that the memory of the container is not less than 8G, so as to avoid errors due to insufficient memory.

For the resource setting method for the container, please refer to:

- Mac user: <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#advanced>
- Linux user: <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#memory>
